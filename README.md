## Frontend Mentor - Arch Studio multi-page website

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email` or `Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the contact page map. The addresses we have on the design are fictional, so you'll need to add real addresses for this bonus task.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT** ‚ö†Ô∏è: If you choose to do the bonus part of the challenge and use a mapping API, we recommend using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/). It's free to use and doesn't require an API Key. If you decide to use another API, like Google Maps or Mapbox, be sure to secure your API Key. Here are guides for both Google Maps and Mapbox, be sure to read through them thoroughly:

- [API Key best practices from Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/maps/api-key-best-practices)
- [How to use Mapbox securely](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/troubleshooting/how-to-use-mapbox-securely/)

Exposing your API Key publicly can lead to other people using it to make requests for their own application if the proper precautions aren't in place. Please be sure you read the guides thoroughly and follow their recommendations.

**We don't take any responsibility if you expose your API Key while completing the challenge and have not secured it.**

### Expected Behaviour

The following points are to clarify behaviour for areas where you might not be sure what's expected.

#### Home

- When one of the 3 Featured projects near the bottom are clicked, navigate to the `/portfolio` page.

#### Portfolio

- The thumbnails on the `/portfolio` index page should be anchor tags but should not link anywhere. If this were a real site, these could link to the project websites individually.

#### Contact

- Clicking on "View on Map" should scroll down to the map if you're using the static images
- If you're using Google Maps, clicking on "View on Map" should highlight the office that the link was clicked for

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the Sketch design file provided. You can download the design file on the platform. It comes with a `README.md` file as well to help you get set up on Sketch or other popular design tools like Figma and Adobe XD.

You will also find mobile, tablet, desktop, and active state designs in JPG format if you wish to use them.

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. For some images, we have provided desktop, tablet, and mobile versions. This will allow you to optimize which image you display based on the user's device size. If you don't see a tablet or mobile version for an image, it's because the desktop image is near enough the same dimensions or the image isn't displayed for those screen sizes.

The design system in the Sketch file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.
